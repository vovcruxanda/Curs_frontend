# Tribute Page Project

This is a simple project dedicated to a selected famous people. I really love science so I made a tribute page for Marie Curie.

We see a styled menu and a cover image that catch attention of the reader with an action button. The colors are matched to the science domain that is representated by Marie Curie.
